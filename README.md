# This project is a fork of dtinth/comic-mono-font

That project was to create a font. This project is designed to use the generate.py script and use it to take a proportional spaced font and make it a mono spaced font.

This may be a very silly idea.  I have got the script to work to generate a mono spaced font from a proportional font.  The key is tweaking the height and width so the fonts look nice.
